# WORDLE GAME CLONE

This is not a perfect coypcat of the popular wordle game developed by the [Nytimes] https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html website.
[Thecodercoder's] https://github.com/thecodercoder/wordle-clone replicate was a big inspiration and reference in terms of the logic side.

## RULES OF THE GAME

- Only letters (uppercase/lowercase) are allowed.
- A limit of 6 tries to guess the correct generated word.
- The game finishes either by guessing the word correctly or reaching out the fixed guess limit.
